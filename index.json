My tech hobby involves constantly trying something new. Although my professional interests primarily lie in infrastructure and cloud computing (especially in Machine Learning contexts), I have ventured into other areas such as Blockchain, Cyber Security, LLMs, NLP, Game Development, and Robotics.\nI take great pleasure in customizing my entire workflow and development environment. As a user of Arch (btw), i3wm, tmux, and Neovim, I appreciate the freedom to choose what I like and dislike. I believe that being able to create a comfortable and exciting experience while accomplishing what you need is a crucial component of happiness and personal fulfillment at work. Everything becomes more challenging (and not in a good way) if you cannot enjoy it with a sense of fun.\nMy personal future interests are geared towards contributing more to Open Source (especially to Neovim), engaging in more coding challenges (e.g., Codeforces), and cultivating more hobbies in real life. After all, one cannot subsist on bits alone.\nThis site # My quest for an enhanced development experience has led me to explore some obscure tools and places. The purposes of this site, apart from sharing my thoughts, are to offer a supportive platform for those who seek the same things I do (and, of course, to serve as a secondary memory for me in case I forget how to do \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo;).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s connect! # Like I said, I am always looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute. If you want to reach out, feel free to message me.\n\u0026ldquo;We could be so much better if we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be so good\u0026rdquo; - Sigmund Freud\n","date":"27 January 2024","permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Who I am # I am a Computer Science student at Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), a Linux and Open Source enthusiast, and a Pokémon trainer.","title":""},{"content":"Hello! my name is Paulo and I’m a Site Reliability Engineer based in Brazil.
